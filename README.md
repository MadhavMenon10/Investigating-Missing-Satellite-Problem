# Investigating-Missing-Satellite-Problem (MSP)
This was an independent research project under the guidance of PhD student Cannon Vogel.

This project aims at investigating the MSP - disparities between N-body simulations and experimental observations which show there to be too few satellites as theory would predict. To do this, the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) — a Boltzmann Solver — was used to simulate five dark matter particles to investigate their ability to help explain the MSP.
